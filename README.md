# Where_is_Waldo

## Overview
This project utilizes the YoLoV8 model to train on images from the classic children's book "Where's Waldo?". The goal is to enable the model to identify and mark the location of Waldo within the images.

## Features
- **Model Training**: Trained using images from "Where's Waldo?" to enhance the model's ability to detect Waldo in various scenarios.
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes the YoLoV8 model for accurate detection, ensuring high performance in identifying Waldo.
- **User Interface**: Front-end interface built with PySide6 for user interaction, allowing users to upload images and view results seamlessly.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adsl135789/Where_is_waldo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Where_is_waldo
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the application using PySide6 to start identifying Waldo in images. The user can upload images, and the model will process them to highlight Waldo's location.
